# Oh look, it's a Chrinkus

I'm a 42 year old hobbyist programmer from Canada. I participate in coding challenges for fun, make games for more fun and then crash and burn in a losing battle with imposter-syndrome.

Lately I've been experimenting with SDL2 and library writing. Of course, now that it's December I'll be cranking out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions as the daily puzzles drop.

## Language Skills

I started with JavaScript and soon moved to C++. After a few years of that I decided to dip a little deeper and test the mysterious waters of C. Along the way I've picked up some HTML/CSS, SQL and Make.

Most of my work this year has been in C99 and learning how to better build my projects using CMake.

## Looking to Collaborate

I'm strongly interested in participating in any projects that utilize the languages I know. I'm most interested in:
- Network programming
- SDL2 Game development
- GTK application development

### What is a Chrinkus?

I grew up gaming in the 80's with my NES and spent a LOT of time in the Zelda universe. As I got older (and games were able to save longer than 6 characters per name) I expanded to signify my love of the Metroid series.

`Chrinkus = CHRis + lINK + samUS`
